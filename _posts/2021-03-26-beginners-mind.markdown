title:  "Beginner's Mind"
---

This is the last day of my six week virtual stay at the Recurse Center. I don't really feel like taking stock of what I did, mostly because it would make this feel too much like an ending, and also because there's already some other posts here, so I thought that, instead, I'd try to write something about the idea of [Beginner's Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) and how it relates to programming.

#### Join me in a little experiment

Let's first try to experience together what Beginner's Mind feels like, with a little experiment.

1. First **think of a thing**:
* that you know nothing about and
* that you think you would find really interesting.

   Your *thing* doesn't have to be anything very specific or well-defined, it can be very broad (maybe "Python", or "perspective drawing", or "folk music", or "meditation").

   Got something? Good.[^begin0]

2. Now **imagine** yourself **beginning** to learn more about this thing. 

   Don't actually do it. Just imagine yourself opening a browser and searching for information, or opening a wonderful book about the topic, or buying your first drawing set ever, or listening to a meditation expert. Go ahead. Just imagine it for a couple of seconds. Maybe thirty seconds. I'll be here, waiting.

3. How do you feel? **Write** down three words. Okay, you can have five words. Or ten. Write down as many words as you like.[^begin-words]

If nothing else, I hope this little experiment helped you remember how a beginner's mind feels, in case you'd forgotten. 

Here's a bit more reflection on how this relates to my experience over the past six weeks.

#### Applied Beginner's Mind
This beginner's mind feels pretty great, if you ask me. Someone who is first learning something can often be eager, curious, open-minded, full of energy. If you feel like you're a "beginner" at something, then, generally speaking, 

* it feels OK to make **mistakes** (because you're just starting out), 
* relatively small achievements can lead to **great joy** (because you're making quick progress),
* there is no pressure to **remember** stuff you learned before (because there isn't any),
* you're not worried about things being really **hard** to attain (because you haven't even tried).

Now here's the big magic trick:

> You can bring a beginner's mind **to things you already know something about**.
   
In at least some views of Buddhism, this is the main idea that [meditation teachers](https://archive.org/details/zenmindbeginners00suzu/page/21/mode/2up) try to teach, because, they write, "in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few." There you have something to put on a tile.

#### Star battle: an actual beginner among experts

Just last night, I attended a "puzzle party" event with several of my fellow batch-mates who had gotten really good at the [Star Battle puzzle](https://www.puzzle-star-battle.com/). I had never seen this puzzle before, but I liked it a lot, a sort of Sudoku but all stars and no numbers. ⭐☆✰⛤

I spent about 1.5hrs with them, during which we first did a supposedly "easy" one (which I found to be pretty hard) and then a hard one (which I then found to be do-able, with a little help from my friends). I learned so much about this puzzle, just by "osmosis" from the experts (virtually) around me.[^begin1]

I think it was a **big** help for me that I was coming at it as a beginner, but surrounded by experts. It made me feel at the same time curious, excited, and also totally OK to say I wasn't getting something, asking for help, asking the experts to slow down. The fact that the topic I was learning was "just" a puzzle and not something more "serious" like, oh I don't know, CSS, also helped me feel comfortable.  Which brings me to:

#### Asking for help and saying that you don't know

If there's a favorite meta-skill I got better at during my batch, it must be asking for help. Here's some honesty (I think you deserve it if you made it this far through this post): when I feel confident about a topic, I like to talk about it and help people with it, but when I feel uncertain or don't know much about something myself, I do not always find it easy to say so and ask for help. 

This gets way worse when it is something that I feel like I'm "supposed to know". Fortunately, the Recurse Center has created a culture and community where it feels genuinely OK to ask, ask again, no stupid questions, explain like I am five, and then ask again. Often, the questions I have that I think are the *most* stupid turn out to lead to the most interesting or fun results, like the time I asked if there was a way to make C compiler messages friendlier, it seemed like there wasn't, [and so I ended up making a (tiny) prototype](https://github.com/mnopqr1/friendlycompiler) (which incidentally also taught me something about how to make emoji appear in the terminal):

#### Compilers: from superficial to in-depth

Speaking of compilers, I sort-of knew what a compiler was doing before I started my batch, but then during my batch I did [two](https://github.com/mnopqr1/MyNand2Tetris) [projects](https://github.com/mnopqr1/myclox) on writing compilers from scratch (the second still very much work in progress). Even though I already knew something about the topic going in, it was so much *fun* and I was so *eager* to 
Learning what is involved for the computer to "understand" the Python or Javascript or C code I write is something that helped me get a much more in-depth mental image of how programming works, by seeing how things work "under the hood". [This post by Julia has a lot more to say about that](https://jvns.ca/blog/learn-how-things-work/), also about asking questions, and it served as an inspiration for this post.

[^begin0]: When I did it myself just now, I thought of DNA, mRNA, Crispr, all things bio-tech. What did you think of? Leave comments below. Oops, there is no comments section yet because I know nothing about how to go about coding a comments section on the web. That could be an interesting *thing* too.

[^begin-words]: Here's what I wrote: "curious, excited, a little scared, open minded, energetic". What were yours? (... I really need that comments section.)

[^begin1]: I tried just now on [puzzle-star-battle.com](https://www.puzzle-star-battle.com/) and was able to solve an easy 5x5 one in 1 minute 10 seconds. I doubt that I would have gotten anywhere under 5 minutes before "pairing" on this puzzle.
