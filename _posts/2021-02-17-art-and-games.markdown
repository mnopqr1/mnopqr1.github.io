I've been collecting some ideas for projects that could be cool to try to implement and get my feet wet[^1] in web development. This is just an brainstorm-y list for now in the order of excitement:

* **A platform game for learning kanji (Japanese characters).**
    So I've been learning kanji through a [_spaced repetition_ system](https://www.wanikani.com) that does a pretty good job of gamifying the grind, but wouldn't it be cool if the mnemonics would be visual instead of textual? 
    
    Something like: the game starts out in a [great wavy ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa) made up of 水's, and you can only get out by typing in what that character means (water). After you get out of the water you hit a brown 木-shaped thing that you have trouble getting around, but you manage by typing "tree". Then all of a sudden the tree catches fire 火. To be developed further. 

* **A math-y art project in p5js.**
    I would like to make a theorem visualization that is as pretty as [this](https://ity.cool/dh). Maybe I should begin by taking advice and "deconstruct" that work, i.e., understand how it works without looking at the source code and reproduce it myself. Could also continue with the [sieve animation](https://mnopqr1.github.io/2021/02/15/eratosthenes-animated.html) idea, try to make it prettier, experiment with changing the grid shape and the block shape.

* **Art critic bot.**
    A bot that you can give an artwork and it writes a incomprehensible jargon-filled review. Perhaps by learning from actual reviews? This idea is inspired by an old meme I couldn't find but is similar to the [Instant Art Critique Phrase Generator](http://www.pixmaven.com/phrase_generator.html)[^2], but I haven't seen it done with the input aspect. It could also work as a movie/tv critic. Might be easier to do because there are already more (human) review aggregator sites that may have data.

    Vaguely related inspirations for this one that are also just links I don't want to lose so I put them here: [Guardian article written by what they call a "robot"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3) and [a neural network that draws illustrations](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/).

But first I've got to eat breakfast and finish writing that compiler.

[^1]: Is that the expression in English? I think so. At least now I learned how to create footnotes in markdown. Ha. 

[^2]: I just put in the random number 23416 and it said: "I find this work menacing/playful because of the way the optical suggestions of the facture seems very disturbing in light of the essentially transitional quality." Yes.
