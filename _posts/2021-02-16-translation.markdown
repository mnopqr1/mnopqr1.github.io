Shower thought: programming, or maybe even generally a lot of math & computer science, is really about _translation_. I'm learning about parsers and grammars by working through [Nand2Tetris Project 10](https://nand2tetris.org/project10) and it is all about analyzing sequences of words and shaping them into a form that then makes it easy to translate the code into a VM bytecode. Not so different from when you learn a (human) language, Japanese, say, and you first have to learn to parse the separate characters, or even parts of separate characters, before you can put them together to understand what a sentence means, and then later what a text means.

On a different level, when you write a program that implements an algorithm, you translate the pseudocode in your head or on a whiteboard into whatever programming language you're writing in. When you prove a math theorem, you translate informal arguments about why it should be true into the (more or less) formal language of proofs.

When you start to become fluent in a second human language, you stop mentally translating from your native language, and start thinking (and dreaming) in that second language. Does something similar happen with programming? Has a good Python programmer assimilated the language to such an extent that they think directly "in Python", without passing through informal pseudocode?

Just some Tuesday morning musings. Time to stop procrastinating and continue work on my parser.
